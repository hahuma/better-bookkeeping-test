# Better Bookkeeping Demo App

This repo is meant to be representative of how we're building features in the better bookkeeping ecosystem. We're going all in on the TanStack world and dockerizing our apps. In reality the UI components and Database connection logic is installed from external packages, but it's all bundled here for easy access and getting started

This repo is scaffolded as a simple workout tracking app. The user configures the movements in their workouts (e.g. bench-press, dumbbell curls etc.)

In the "Current Workout" section the user will create a new workout, and add "sets" to that workout. Each set includes a selected movement, a weight for that movement and a number of reps

Once the user hits "complete workout" that workout will be added to their history and can be viewed in the "workout history" section

## Feature Request

1. Add weight tracking section where a user can input their weight. This should be something they can track over time. Add a chart showing the history of that

2. The current setup doesn't support body-weight movements very well (e.g. pullups / pushups) update the "movements page" so a user can flag a movement as "body-weight" when they create it. When a "body-weight" movement is added to the current workout the weight field should default to the most recent user-inputted weight

3. The Workout history should give the user a sense of progression. One way to do this is to show certain summary metrics for each movement and their progression over time. Please implement a chart where a user can select a movement and a corresponding metric and see that metric plotted against time.
   metrics:
   - maximium weight (the maximum weight for that movement on a given day)
   - total reps
   - total volume (volume of a set is weight \* reps total volume for a movement is total volume of all sets in a workout)

4. There are no tests! Please create some unit tests for the following core behaviors:
   Movements: create / read / delete
   Sets: create / read / delete
   Workouts: create / read / delete

Stretch Goals open-ended asks - address any or all of these to show of your dev super powers!

- Get creative - how would you add a nutrition tracking to this app? Macros (Carb / Protein / Fats) and Calories & Calory surplus/deficit
- database design / performance upgrade - let us know what we're doing wrong. Show us how you would tackle harder problems like admin boards to summarize users in the system
- security audit / improvement - let us know what we're doing wrong. Show us how you would tackle harder problems like account sharing or admin access
- general UI cleanup / update - the UI here is totally basic. Show us some improvements you'd make to make this app look clean and professional

There will be a code review on what you write! So be prepared to explain how and why you implemented these features!
