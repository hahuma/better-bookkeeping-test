# Better Bookkeeping Demo App

A simple workout tracking app built with TanStack Start. Users can configure movements (e.g. bench-press, dumbbell curls), create workouts with sets, and view their workout history.

## Feature Requests

1. Add weight tracking section where a user can input their weight. This should be something they can track over time. Add a chart showing the history of that

2. The current setup doesn't support body-weight movements very well (e.g. pullups / pushups) update the "movements page" so a user can flag a movement as "body-weight" when they create it. When a "body-weight" movement is added to the current workout the weight field should default to the most recent user-inputted weight

3. The Workout history should give the user a sense of progression. One way to do this is to show certain summary metrics for each movement and their progression over time. Please implement a chart where a user can select a movement and a corresponding metric and see that metric plotted against time.
   Metrics:
   - maximum weight (the maximum weight for that movement on a given day)
   - total reps
   - total volume (volume of a set is weight \* reps, total volume for a movement is total volume of all sets in a workout)

4. There are no tests! Please create some unit tests for the following core behaviors:
   - Movements: create / read / delete
   - Sets: create / read / delete
   - Workouts: create / read / delete

5. **Security Fix**: The authentication system stores passwords in plaintext. Please implement proper password hashing using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, argon2). Update the sign-up and sign-in flows accordingly.

### Stretch Goals

- Get creative - how would you add nutrition tracking to this app? Macros (Carb / Protein / Fats) and Calories & Calorie surplus/deficit
- Database design / performance upgrade - let us know what we're doing wrong. Show us how you would tackle harder problems like admin boards to summarize users in the system
- Security audit / improvement - beyond password hashing, what other security improvements would you make? Consider things like rate limiting, CSRF protection, or session management
- General UI cleanup / update - the UI here is totally basic. Show us some improvements you'd make to make this app look clean and professional

There will be a code review on what you write! So be prepared to explain how and why you implemented these features.
